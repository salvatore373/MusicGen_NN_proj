# Salvatore Michele Rago, Mattia Maffongelli: MusicGen_NN
In this GitHub repository, we present the study and the corresponding implemented code of the paper titled ["MusicGen, a simple and controllable model for music generation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05284).
MusicGen is an **auto-regressive Transformer** model trained using a 32kHz EnCodec tokenizer with 4 codebooks sampled at 50 Hz
